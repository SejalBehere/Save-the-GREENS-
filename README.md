# Premise for Save the GREENS!!!

In this game rabbits have invaded the good captain’s field and so the captain must harvest as 
many of the vegetables as possible before they are consumed by the leporine menace. 
In the game, Captain Veggie moves about the field and attempts to harvest vegetables by moving 
on top of them. The captain scores points for each vegetable they harvest. At the same
time, the rabbits also randomly hop about consuming any vegetables they land on. The
game continues until all of the vegetables have been removed from the field, after which the 
player’s score is displayed to the screen.
