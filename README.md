# Save-the-GREENS!!!
Project 2 for EE 553-A Engineering Programming: C++ 

The rabbits have invaded the good captainâ€™s field and Captain Veggie must harvest as 
many of the vegetables as possible before they are consumed by the leporine menace. 
Help Captain move about the field and harvest vegetables. The captain scores points for each 
vegetable harvested. The rabbits also randomly hop about consuming any vegetables they land on. The
game continues until all of the vegetables have been removed from the field or have been eaten by 
the rabbits, after which the your score will be displayed.
